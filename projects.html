        <div class="words">I am from Duluth, Georgia, have lived there my entire life, and couldn't imagine being anywhere else than idyllic suburban Georgia.</div> 
        <div class="words">My parents met when they were students at Georgia Tech, so I've always grown up in a Tech house and travelled down to the city pretty often for football games. Both of my older siblings also ended up going to Tech, so I was basically destined end up here.</div> 
        <div class="words">Since I could remember, my parents had all three kids playing sports. I did my fair share of soccer games, softball games, and tennis matches throughout the years, but because of this, I ended up playing soccer for almost 12 years before I had surgery on both of my knees and ultimately had to quit since I now basically have the knees of the 90 year old.</div> 
        <div class="words">Though this time was hard on me physically, I also had a lot of recovery time just sitting on the couch in which I was able to develop my skills as a digital designer, specifically through the Adobe Creative Suite. I was able to become a sort of freelance worker at my highschool and created designs for any event, club, or need presented to me. During this time, I was able to apply my design skills and notice my interest in digital design and eventually computational media.</div>
